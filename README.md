# Reawired
This is an automated calendar designed to understand and schedule events on Natural Language Instructs

## Goal:
Reawired is an end to end-to-end product. From model to deployment via a user interfaces and APis for integration on existing platforms. Through its interfaces, it recieves an instruct in natural language to register or book an event. An example of such an instruct would be:
"Push my exam scheduled for friday next week to Saturday 3pm"
"I want to learn openCV for the next two days within 9pm to 12pm starting tomorrow"
The model should be able to get the **message, the timing of event, the action (schedule or reschedule) and the reccurence of event/activity.** The models job is to obtain this information accurately from the user, share it with software that manages the user's calendar to execute. It will be interactive to effectively get and confirm the information it has obtained and the actions it has executed.

## Specialty
Siri, google assistant, microsoft To Do and Alexa are already excellent use cases of this technology at the entry level. Reawired takes it up the notch thus:
1. **Focus:** Reawired is wired up to take care of your time (and eventually finance). New algorithms will be built on it to optimize for the best personal time manageer there exist. It will be able to track long-term goals and the users progress.
2. **Resheduling:** Existing systems are not effecient in rescheuling. This a niche for Reawired. Effectively solving the problem of moving events like chess pieces on a chess board makes us standout.
3. **Base:** this platform is the basis for more useful software in managing personal time and management. Communities can be built around this technology geared at fostering competition and tracking development on any measurable skill, seemlessly.

   Comfort is what is on sale here. Ease of managing time.
